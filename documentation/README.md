# Feature Specifications

This folder is where you describe **what you want to build**.

## How It Works

1. **You write a spec** - Describe your feature in plain language (see template below)
2. **Run `/start`** - Claude Code reads your spec from this folder
3. **AI agents take over** - Planning, coding, testing, and quality checks happen automatically

## Quick Start

1. Copy the template below into a new file (e.g., `my-feature.md`)
2. Fill in the sections with your requirements
3. Run `/start` in Claude Code

## Spec Template

Create a new `.md` file in this folder with the following structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Your Feature Name]

## Overview
[1-2 sentences describing what this feature does and why it's needed]

## User Stories

### As a [type of user], I want to [do something] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance criteria 1
- Acceptance criteria 2

### As a [type of user], I want to [do something else] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance criteria 1
- Acceptance criteria 2

## Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Optional requirement 1

## UI/UX Notes (if applicable)
[Describe any specific UI requirements, layouts, or user flows]

## Technical Notes (optional)
[Any technical constraints or preferences - leave blank if unsure]
```

## Example Spec

Here's a simple example:

```markdown
# Feature: User Profile Page

## Overview
Allow users to view and edit their profile information.

## User Stories

### As a logged-in user, I want to view my profile so that I can see my account details
- Display user's name, email, and avatar
- Show account creation date
- Show current role/permissions

### As a logged-in user, I want to edit my profile so that I can update my information
- Allow editing name and avatar
- Email changes require verification
- Show success message after saving

## Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] Profile page accessible from navigation menu
- [ ] Display current user information
- [ ] Edit form with validation
- [ ] Save changes to backend API

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Avatar upload functionality
- [ ] Profile completion percentage

## UI/UX Notes
- Use a card layout for profile sections
- Edit mode should be inline (not a separate page)
```

## Tips for Writing Good Specs

- **Be specific** - "Users can filter by date" is better than "Users can search"
- **Think about edge cases** - What happens when something goes wrong?
- **Include examples** - Sample data helps clarify requirements
- **Keep it simple** - Start small, you can always add more features later

## What Happens Next?

After you run `/start`, the AI workflow will:

1. **DESIGN** (optional) - Create wireframes if your feature has UI
2. **PLAN** - Break your spec into epics and stories
3. **SPECIFY** - Generate test cases for each story
4. **IMPLEMENT** - Write the code to pass those tests
5. **REVIEW** - Check code quality and security
6. **VERIFY** - Run all quality gates before creating a PR

You'll be asked for approval at key checkpoints along the way.

## Need Help?

- Run `/feature` to see all available commands
- Check [Getting Started](../.template-docs/Getting-Started.md) for setup help
- Ask Claude Code: "How do I write a good feature spec?"
