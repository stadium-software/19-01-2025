# Step 4: Review & Validation

Before finalizing your work, review and validate your changes to ensure quality and compliance.

- **Code Review:** Automated agents will check your code for quality, security, and best practices.
- **Quality Gates:** Pre-commit hooks and CI workflows will block invalid commits and enforce standards (lint, type check, tests).
- **Session Logging:** Your activity is logged for traceability and future reference.

Follow the prompts to address any issues. If all checks pass, you're ready to commit and deploy.
