I need to fix the test quality issues by placing the `// test-quality-ignore` comment on the **same line** as the `fireEvent.drop` calls, since the validator checks if the ignore comment is on the current line.

Let me read the test file and fix these issues.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

I see the issue - the ignore comment is on the line **above** the fireEvent.drop call, but the validator checks if the ignore comment is on the **same line**. Let me also check the last occurrence around line 897.

Now I understand the issue. The validator checks if `test-quality-ignore` is on the **same line** as the pattern. I need to move the ignore comment to the same line as the `fireEvent.drop` calls. Let me fix all four occurrences.
