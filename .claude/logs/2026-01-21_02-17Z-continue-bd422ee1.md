I'll analyze the current project state to determine where to resume the TDD workflow.

All tests are passing. Let me check the acceptance test status in the Epic 4 story files to determine where we are in the workflow.

All Epic 4 stories have checked acceptance tests. Let me verify this and check the Epic 5 status.

Now I have a clear picture of the project state. Let me also verify Epic 4's VERIFY phase is complete by checking the quality gates.

Excellent! All quality gates are passing. Here's the current workflow status:

## ðŸ“‹ Project State Analysis

| Epic | Name | Status | Phase |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Epic 1 | Report Batches | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 2 | Portfolio Files Import | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 3 | Other Files Import | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 4 | Instrument Static Data | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 5 | Index Prices, Durations & Betas | â³ Not Started | SPECIFY |

### Current Position
- **Epic 4** is complete - all 9 stories have acceptance tests checked `[x]`, tests passing, lint/build clean
- **Epic 5** has 12 stories planned but no tests generated yet

### Uncommitted Changes
There are modified story files and test files from Epic 4 that need to be committed:
- Story files: 04-02, 04-03, 04-04, 04-05, 04-07, 04-08
- Test files: instrument-audit-history.test.tsx, instrument-popup.test.tsx
- Component files: InstrumentDetailPopup.tsx, InstrumentGrid.tsx

## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Commit Epic 4 completion** - The changes from Epic 4 should be committed before starting Epic 5
2. **Clear context** - Type `/clear` to reset context before starting Epic 5
3. **Start Epic 5** - Generate tests for Index Prices, Durations & Betas stories

Would you like me to:
1. **Commit Epic 4 changes** and prepare for Epic 5?
2. **Proceed directly to Epic 5 SPECIFY phase** (generate tests for the 12 stories)?
3. **Show detailed status** of what needs to be committed?
