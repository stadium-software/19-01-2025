I'll continue marking the Epic 3 story acceptance tests as complete. Let me read the remaining story files and update them.

Now I need to address the user's request to update instructions in all relevant files to remember the 3 steps when starting a new epic: (1) create new branch, (2) clear context, (3) follow workflow. Let me read CLAUDE.md and update it with this important guidance.

Now I need to add a section about the mandatory steps when starting a new epic. I'll add this to the "Git Branching Strategy" section since it relates to branch creation and workflow.

I have completed all tasks:

**Summary of completed work:**

1. **Marked Epic 3 story acceptance tests as complete** in all 6 story files:
   - [story-03-01-display-bloomberg-section.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-01-display-bloomberg-section.md)
   - [story-03-02-display-custodian-section.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-02-display-custodian-section.md)
   - [story-03-03-display-additional-section.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-03-display-additional-section.md)
   - [story-03-04-upload-other-files.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-04-upload-other-files.md)
   - [story-03-05-view-other-file-errors.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-05-view-other-file-errors.md)
   - [story-03-06-navigate-data-confirmation.md](generated-docs/stories/story-03-06-navigate-data-confirmation.md)

2. **Updated [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** with a new section "CRITICAL: Mandatory Steps When Starting a New Epic" that documents the 3 required steps:
   - **Step 1:** Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/epic-<N>-<short-name>`)
   - **Step 2:** Clear context (remind user to type `/clear`)
   - **Step 3:** Follow the TDD workflow (SPECIFY â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ VERIFY)

The instructions also clarify that these steps should NOT be skipped even when:
- The conversation was restored from a summary/compaction
- The user says "continue" without specifying context
- Previous epic just completed in the same session

I'll analyze the current project state to resume the TDD workflow.

Now I have a clear picture of the project state.

**Project Status Summary:**

| Epic | Name | Status | Phase |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Epic 1 | Start Page & Report Batch Management | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 2 | Portfolio File Import Dashboard | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 3 | Other Files Import Dashboard | âœ… Complete | VERIFIED |
| Epic 4-10 | Remaining Epics | â³ Planned | SPECIFY |

**Current State:**
- **Branch:** `feature/epic-2-portfolio-files` (still on Epic 2 branch)
- **Tests:** 210 passed, 38 skipped
- **Quality Gates:** All passing
- **Epic 3:** All acceptance tests marked complete (`[x]`)
- **Uncommitted Changes:** Epic 3 implementation files and updated story files

**Next Steps:**

1. **Commit Epic 3 work** on the current branch
2. **Create PR or continue to Epic 4**

Before starting Epic 4, following the mandatory steps documented in CLAUDE.md:
1. Create a new branch: `feature/epic-4-instrument-maintenance`
2. Clear context (user action)
3. Follow TDD workflow

Would you like me to:
1. **Commit the current Epic 3 work** first (recommended)
2. **Start Epic 4** (which requires creating a new branch and clearing context)
